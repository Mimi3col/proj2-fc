## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I had a tough time making the forward button pick a random card, I ended up using the random with the range from 0 to the max amount of cards, so sometimes a card will be repeated. Another challenge I had was getting the correct output on the card after it was clicked, I ended up using an if statement that is depending on the value in count.
